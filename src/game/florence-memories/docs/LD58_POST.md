# Florence Memories

A meditative cloud-watching game about collecting memories from the sky.

## The Story

On a beautiful sunny day, a family goes hiking together. They find the perfect spot ‚Äî a soft patch of grass overlooking the sky ‚Äî and lie down to watch the clouds drift by.

As they gaze up at the endless blue, something magical happens. The clouds begin to form shapes: a teddy bear, a butterfly, a rainbow. Each shape sparks a memory, a dream, or a moment of love.

**"Can you see it?"**

## Theme: Collection

**Florence Memories** embodies the Ludum Dare 58 theme through:

- **Collecting Fleeting Moments**: Like watching clouds drift by, you're gathering treasures that won't last forever
- **Building Stories**: Each of the 12 memories represents something special ‚Äî from adventures in nature to cozy moments at home
- **Preserving Wonder**: The collection mechanic asks you to be patient and attentive, just like lying in the grass and marveling at the world

## The Journey

This is a game about slowing down. About being present. About the simple joy of lying in the grass with the people you love and watching the world drift by.

As you watch the sky, clouds will form into shapes ‚Äî 12 unique memories waiting to be discovered. A teddy bear. A butterfly dancing on the breeze. A rainbow promising adventure. Each one is a fleeting moment of wonder, highlighted for just a few seconds before it fades back into the sky.

Click on them during their brief window of light, and watch as they transform into memories in your family scrapbook. Each memory has a story ‚Äî little moments of love, dreams, and the beauty of everyday life.

The journey takes about 5-10 minutes, but there's no rush. The clouds will keep drifting. The sky will keep waiting. This is a moment to breathe, to wonder, and to remember what it feels like to simply *be* with the people beside you.

When you've collected all 12 memories, the sky has one final gift waiting for you.

## Why I Love Ludum Dare

There's something magical about game jams. The creative rush, the tight deadlines, the challenge of turning a single theme into something playable in just 48 hours. I absolutely love participating in Ludum Dare events ‚Äî they push me to experiment, to tell stories I wouldn't normally tell, and to create experiences that come straight from the heart.

This jam was special. This time, I wanted to make something peaceful, something personal, something that captures a perfect moment in time.
