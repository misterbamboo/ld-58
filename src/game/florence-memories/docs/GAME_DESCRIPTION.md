# Florence Memories

## A Meditative Journey Through Childhood

Florence lies in a hospital bed, watching clouds drift past her window. Each cloud formation carries a memory — fragments of joy, wonder, and love from her childhood. As the morphine flows through her veins, the boundaries between sky and memory blur, and she reaches out to collect these precious moments one last time.

This is Florence's final gift to herself: a collection of everything that made life beautiful.

## Theme: Collection

"Florence Memories" embodies the **Ludum Dare 58 theme of Collection** on multiple levels:

**Literal Collection**: Players gather 12 unique cloud formations, each representing a cherished childhood memory. These memories fill a hand-drawn book, creating a tangible record of Florence's life.

**Emotional Collection**: Beyond the mechanical act of clicking, players are collecting moments of wonder — the feeling of chasing butterflies, the warmth of family road trips, the comfort of a teddy bear's smile. Each memory's description invites reflection on the universal experiences that shape us.

**Temporal Collection**: The game explores how we collect and preserve our past as we face our future. Florence isn't gathering new experiences; she's reaching back to hold onto what made her who she is. The act of collection becomes an act of remembrance, acceptance, and celebration.

**Meditative Collection**: Unlike frantic collection mechanics, this game asks players to slow down, watch, and wait for the right moment. The clouds drift at their own pace, and some shapes will slip away if you're not attentive. This mirrors how memories themselves can fade if we don't take time to acknowledge them.

## The Story

Florence is in her final hours, surrounded by the gentle hum of hospital equipment and the endless sky outside her window. Through the morphine haze, the clouds take on familiar shapes — a dog that looks just like the puppy she cuddled during rainstorms, a butterfly like the ones she chased through summer gardens, a star like the shooting star her whole family wished upon around the campfire.

Each cloud formation is fleeting, drifting across the sky for only a moment before dissolving back into formless white. Florence knows she must be quick, must reach out and touch each memory while she still can. Click. A teddy bear with a missing ear. Click. The taste of strawberries shared with her parents. Click. Grandpa's voice saying "luck finds those who keep smiling."

As each memory is captured, it flies into her memory book — a small, worn journal resting on her bedside table. One by one, the pages fill with drawings and words, a physical manifestation of a life well-lived.

When all twelve memories are gathered, something magical happens. The clouds themselves form Florence's face — a young girl, smiling, forever frozen in the joy of childhood. She reaches out one last time...

And the sky welcomes her home.

## How to Play

### Getting Started
1. Click **Play** to begin your journey
2. Read the tutorial screen (click anywhere to dismiss)
3. The sky begins to fill with drifting clouds

### Collecting Memories

**Watch the Sky**: Clouds continuously drift across the screen from right to left. Most are simple atmospheric clouds, but some will slowly form into recognizable shapes.

**Wait for the Highlight**: When a cloud formation fully materializes, a **glowing outline** will appear around it for approximately **5 seconds**. This is your window to capture the memory.

**Click to Collect**: Click anywhere on the highlighted shape during this brief window. The formation will gently fade away, and the memory will fly into your book.

**Track Your Progress**: A small book icon appears in the bottom-right corner of the screen. Click it to expand and see which memories you've collected. Each memory has a title and a heartfelt description from Florence's perspective.

**Patience is Key**: Cloud shapes spawn approximately every 20 seconds. Some memories may take a while to appear, so settle in and enjoy the meditative atmosphere. There are 12 unique memories to collect in total.

## Tips for Players

**Don't Rush**: This is a contemplative experience. Let the clouds wash over you. Read each memory's description in the expanded book view.

**You Can't Fail**: Every memory will eventually appear, and missed opportunities will come around again. There's no time limit or penalty for missing a click.

**Expand the Book**: Click the small book icon to view your collected memories in detail. Each description is a small story worth reading.

**Listen to the Music**: The ambient soundtrack was carefully composed to evoke nostalgia and peace. Consider playing with headphones for the full experience.

**Take Breaks**: The game takes approximately 5-10 minutes to complete, but there's no timer. Step away if needed — the clouds will still be drifting when you return.

## Design Philosophy

"Florence Memories" was created during Ludum Dare 58's 48-hour game jam with a specific vision: to create a space for reflection and gentle emotion in a medium often dominated by action and challenge.

We wanted players to feel:
- The bittersweet beauty of nostalgia
- The quiet dignity of saying goodbye
- The importance of pausing to remember

Every system was designed with intention:
- Clouds drift slowly to encourage patience
- The 5-second highlight window creates moments of presence and attention
- The memory descriptions are written in Florence's voice to build connection
- The ending animation rewards completion with one final moment of wonder

This game is our love letter to the small moments that make life worth collecting.

## Technical Achievement

Built in **Godot Engine 4** using **GDScript**, "Florence Memories" showcases several technical accomplishments within the 48-hour constraint:

- **Dynamic Cloud System**: Individual clouds and cloud formations move with realistic depth perception and parallax
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: A custom MessageBus system coordinates all game systems through decoupled events
- **Procedural Spawning**: Smart collision avoidance ensures cloud shapes never overlap
- **Responsive UI**: The memory book dynamically scales and adapts to different screen sizes
- **Smooth Animations**: Tweened transitions for memory collection, menu screens, and ending sequence
- **Complete Game Loop**: Main menu, tutorial, gameplay, ending animation, credits, and full reset/replay functionality

## A Final Note

If you've lost someone, or if you find yourself looking back more than forward, we hope Florence's story resonates with you.

Remember: the moments we collect — the small joys, the shared laughter, the quiet comforts — these are what make us who we are. They're worth holding onto, worth celebrating, worth one last look at the sky to see if the clouds remember too.

Thank you for watching the clouds with Florence.
