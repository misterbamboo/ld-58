# Feature Request: Initial Cloud System Documentation

## Overview
This feature file documents the **existing implementation** of the cloud system in the Florence Memories game jam project. The purpose is to create a comprehensive PRP that captures the current architecture for future reference and iteration.

## What Already Exists

### 1. Ambient Cloud System
- Individual clouds with phase-based lifecycle (CloudPhase enum)
- Random spawning from screen edges or mid-screen
- Three cloud variants (default, oval, vertical)
- Smooth fade-in, movement, stable period, and fade-out phases
- Auto-disposal when vanished

### 2. Cloud Shape System
- Organic shapes formed from multiple cloud instances
- Pre-computed phase system for performance
- Time-based convergence: shapes appear gradually, converge perfectly at time=0, then disperse
- Interactive highlight system with hover detection
- MessageBus integration for decoupled events

### 3. Core Architecture
- **MessageBus**: Global pub/sub system for events
- **CloudPhase**: Enum-based state management
- **Clean Code**: Small methods, SRP, CQS principles
- **Phase-based timing**: All animations use pre-computed phase data with linear interpolation

## Purpose of This PRP

Create comprehensive documentation that:
1. **Captures current implementation details** for the cloud system
2. **Explains the phase-based architecture** and why it was chosen
3. **Documents patterns** that should be followed in future features
4. **Provides validation gates** to ensure system integrity
5. **Serves as a reference** for extending or modifying the cloud system

## Key Systems to Document

### CloudPhase System
- How phases are defined and managed
- Phase boundary calculation
- Continuity guarantees between phases
- Linear interpolation approach

### Cloud Lifecycle
- Individual cloud behavior (cloud.gd)
- Spawner management (cloud_spawner.gd)
- Phase setup and transitions
- Movement, fading, and squish animations

### Shape System
- Shape composition (multiple clouds forming one shape)
- Time-based convergence mechanics
- Sub-cloud synchronization
- Highlight window and interaction

### MessageBus Integration
- Event topics used
- Pub/sub patterns
- When and how to use MessageBus vs signals

## Success Criteria

A developer reading the PRP should be able to:
1. Understand the entire cloud system architecture
2. Extend the system with new features (new cloud types, new shapes, etc.)
3. Debug issues by understanding the phase lifecycle
4. Validate their changes don't break existing behavior
5. Follow the established patterns and coding standards

## Validation Requirements

The PRP must include:
- **Executable validation gates** (Godot project opening, scene tests)
- **Code references** to specific files and line numbers
- **Pattern examples** from the actual codebase
- **Godot documentation links** for relevant APIs
- **Common pitfalls** specific to the current implementation

## Expected PRP Sections

1. **Context**: Current state of the codebase
2. **Architecture Overview**: High-level design decisions
3. **Component Details**: Each major script explained
4. **Code Patterns**: Reusable patterns with examples
5. **Extension Guide**: How to add new features
6. **Validation**: How to test and verify integrity
7. **Gotchas**: Known issues, edge cases, Godot quirks

## Notes

- This is a **documentation PRP**, not an implementation PRP
- Focus on **teaching** the architecture, not just listing features
- Include **actual code snippets** from the codebase as examples
- Reference **specific line numbers** for key implementations
- Link to **Godot 4 documentation** for APIs used
